Subschema Redux
===
This adds redux to subschema, replacing the existing ValueManager with a redux based backend.   The api is the same
but you get additional visability into the store, and are able to use the tools provided by redux.

***EXPERIMENTAL***

This is very experimental.


TODO:
 - [x] All tests pass when substituted manually.
 - [ ] Make it a single include to switch.
 - [ ] Make tests work with this code.
 - [ ] Write examples for using it.
 - [ ] Write redux resolver for injecting events.
